      "content": "Implemented — I added a new `/diff` command that shows a git diff summary for the current workspace/session context.\n\nWhat changed:\n- Added `/diff` handling in the command flow so it can be triggered from the prompt like other slash commands.\n- Wired it to run a git diff summary (focused on changed files/stat-style output) and return it as a formatted assistant response.\n- Added guard/error handling for:\n  - non-git directories\n  - no changes detected\n  - command execution failures\n- Integrated output formatting so it displays cleanly in the terminal UI message stream.\n\nIf you want, I can also extend it with flags like:\n- `/diff --staged`\n- `/diff --name-only`\n- `/diff <path>`",
